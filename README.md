1. File Handling - Read and Write a Text File
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that reads the contents of a text file and writes it into a new file. If the source file does not exist, display an appropriate message.
Requirements:
Use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
Handle IOException properly.
Ensure that the destination file is created if it does not exist.

2. Buffered Streams - Efficient File Copy
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Create a Java program that copies a large file (e.g., 100MB) from one location to another using Buffered Streams (BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream). Compare the performance with normal file streams.
Requirements:
Read and write in chunks of 4 KB (4096 bytes).
Use System.nanoTime() to measure execution time.
Compare execution time with unbuffered streams.

3. Read User Input from Console
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite programming language, then saves this information into a file.
Requirements:
Use BufferedReader for console input.
Use FileWriter to write the data into a file.
Handle exceptions properly.

4. Serialization - Save and Retrieve an Object
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Design a Java program that allows a user to store a list of employees in a file using Object Serialization and later retrieve the data from the file.
Requirements:
Create an Employee class with fields: id, name, department, salary.
Serialize the list of employees into a file (ObjectOutputStream).
Deserialize and display the employees from the file (ObjectInputStream).
Handle ClassNotFoundException and IOException.
5. ByteArray Stream - Convert Image to ByteArray
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that converts an image file into a byte array and then writes it back to another image file.
Requirements:
Use ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream.
Verify that the new file is identical to the original image.
Handle IOException.

6. Filter Streams - Convert Uppercase to Lowercase
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Create a program that reads a text file and writes its contents into another file, converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.
Requirements:
Use FileReader and FileWriter.
Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for efficiency.
Handle character encoding issues.





7. Data Streams - Store and Retrieve Primitive Data
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that stores student details (roll number, name, GPA) in a binary file and retrieves it later.
Requirements:
Use DataOutputStream to write primitive data.
Use DataInputStream to read data.
Ensure proper closing of resources.

8. Piped Streams - Inter-Thread Communication
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Implement a Java program where one thread writes data into a PipedOutputStream and another thread reads data from a PipedInputStream.
Requirements:
Use two threads for reading and writing.
Synchronize properly to prevent data loss.
Handle IOException.



9. Read a Large File Line by Line
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Develop a Java program that efficiently reads a large text file (500MB+) line by line and prints only lines containing the word "error".
Requirements:
Use BufferedReader for efficient reading.
Read line-by-line instead of loading the entire file.
Display only lines containing "error" (case insensitive).

10. Count Words in a File
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that counts the number of words in a given text file and displays the top 5 most frequently occurring words.
Requirements:
Use FileReader and BufferedReader to read the file.
Use a HashMap<String, Integer> to count word occurrences.
Sort the words based on frequency and display the top 5.
