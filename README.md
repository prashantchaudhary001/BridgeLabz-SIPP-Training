# BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training Repository  

Welcome to my *BridgeLabz SIPP Training Repository*.  
This repository contains the structured learning journey I followed during the SIPP (Skill India Professional Program) with BridgeLabz.  

The repository is divided into multiple branches, with each branch focusing on a specific area of core Java development, object-oriented programming concepts, and data structures & algorithms.  

This organized structure helps in better understanding, practice, and revision of key programming concepts.

## 🗂️ Branches Overview  

### 1️⃣ Core-Java Branch  
This branch focuses on building a strong foundation in Java programming.  
It contains beginner-friendly topics that cover basic syntax, control flow, and core programming constructs.  

*Folders and Topics Included:*  
*Arrays:* Practice programs on array operations and manipulations.
*Built-in Function:* Hands-on examples of Java's in-built functions like Math methods, String methods, etc.
*Control-Flow:* Understanding and implementation of conditional statements, loops, and control structures in Java.
*Methods:* Creating reusable code with user-defined methods and method overloading concepts.
*Programming Elements:* Covers fundamental programming elements such as data types, variables, operators, and input/output handling.
*Strings:* Working with strings in Java, using various string methods for manipulation.

### 2️⃣ OOPS Branch (Object-Oriented Programming)  
This branch is dedicated to the in-depth study of Object-Oriented Programming Principles using Java.  
It focuses on how Java implements core OOP concepts, with practical examples and problem-solving exercises.  

*Folders and Topics Included:*  
*Classes & Objects:* Understanding how to create and work with classes and objects in Java.
*Constructor:* Exploring constructors, their types, and usage in object creation.
*Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface, Abstraction:*
   Deep dive into the four pillars of OOP — protecting data, method overriding, using interfaces, and abstract classes.  
*Inheritance Problems:* Solving practical problems based on inheritance, including single, multi-level, and hierarchical inheritance.
*Oops Design:* Applying design principles to object-oriented code for better structure and maintenance.
*This, Static, Final:* Learning about this keyword, static variables/methods, and the usage of the final keyword.

### 3️⃣ DSA Branch (Data Structures & Algorithms)  
This branch focuses on implementing various data structures and algorithms in Java, along with their time complexities.  
The purpose is to build strong problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.  

*Folders and Topics Included:*  
*LinkedList:* Implementation and manipulation of linked lists.
*Searching Algorithm:* Various searching techniques like linear search, binary search, with time complexity analysis.
*Sorting Algorithms:* Implementations of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.
*Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Function:* Working with Stack and Queue data structures, HashMap, and learning about hashing concepts.
*Time Complexity:* Analyzing and understanding the time complexity of algorithms for optimization.
